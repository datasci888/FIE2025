FIE 2025 AgenticAI Quiz Generation Paper
Abstract
This research-to-practice full paper investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) with long-context window and enhanced retrieval efficiency can generate context-specific quizzes to address high attrition in engineering education. We aim to enable LLMs to process large, multidisciplinary Artificial Intelligence (AI) datasets, covering topics like Machine Learning, Generative AI, and Neural Networks, from foundational to advanced concepts. A systematic literature review identified gaps in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, which often retrieve irrelevant chunks due to context limitations, leading to inaccurate or hallucinated responses \cite{ke2025retrieval, agrawal2024mindfulrag}. Traditional quiz generation lacks modular design, limiting scalability and interpretability. To address this, we developed an agentic long-context RAG architecture using Gemini 1.5â€™s one-million-token window, integrating retrieval, reasoning, and evaluation in a unified pipeline.

Our methodology employed a modular Agentic AI system. A Parsing Agent extracts text from academic sources, followed by a Chunking & Storage Agent segmenting content with 500-character overlaps. An Embedding & Indexing Agent generates and indexes vector embeddings, verified by a Verification Agent for topical alignment. For quiz generation, a Retriever Agent uses cosine similarity and multilingual re-ranking, a Selector Agent filters meaningful chunks, a Response Agent leverages cached ground-truth MCQs with Gemini 1.5 Flash, and an Evaluator Agent assesses outputs using Correctness, Faithfulness, Non-Hallucination, ROUGE, and BERTScore metrics. Experiments on a 150-question benchmark showed accuracy improvements: 78.00\% (raw), 84.00\% (chunks), 89.33\% (chunks+cache), and 93.33\% (1M context+cache) for Gemini, with GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.7 revealing complementary strengths in precision and confidence. This system fosters active recall, supporting conceptual mastery. Future work includes deploying an interactive quiz application and expanding domain-specific datasets across engineering fields.
